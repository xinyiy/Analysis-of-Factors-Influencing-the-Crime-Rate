# Analysis of Factors Influencing the Crime Rate
This project identifies the data science problem of “What Promotes Crime?”. Potential factors, both direct and indirect, including moon phase, weather, days of a week, regional education level and adult obesity/smoking rate are taken into consideration to see how different factors affect certain types of crime more closely.

This is a collaborative group project completed by 4 people.
